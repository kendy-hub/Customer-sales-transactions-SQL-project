## Introduction
## Project Overview
This SQL project aims to analyze and derive valuable insights from two datasets: Sales Transactions and Customer Information. By integrating these datasets, we will explore customer purchasing behavior, debt management, and overall sales performance. The project involves data extraction, transformation, and querying techniques to generate meaningful reports and visualizations that can help businesses make informed decisions.

## Datasets Used
## 1. Sales Transaction Dataset
This dataset captures transactional details related to product sales. Each transaction represents a purchase made by a customer and their outstanding debts.

## 2. Customer Information Dataset
This dataset contains details about customers

 ## TOOLS USED 
The project will leverage:
   i) PostgreSQL for database management 

   ii) DBeaver as the database tool for querying and visualization
                         
## Objectives of the Project

This project aims to achieve the following:
### 1.	Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis by identifying the most frequently purchased products and determine which customers contribute the most sales

### 2.Analyze Sales Transactions by Location .This will determine the total number of transactions per city to identify high_performing and lowest_perfoming  locations,compare transaction volume across different cities to uncover regional sales trends. 

### 3.Business Decision Support that will provide recommedations on which customers are profitable ,identify customers who may require follow_ups due to high debts.

### 4. Identify the Most Purchased Products by ranking products based on sales volume to determine customer preferences and also identify the top-selling and least -selling products over different periods i.e monthly ,quarterly and yearly.
### 5.Evaluate  best Payment Methods whether cash,credit card ,debit card , bank transfer or paypal by analyzing the frequency of each payment method usage to understand customer preferences and also compare the average transaction value for each payment method.

### 6.Analyze Revenue Trends Over Time. This will be done by calculating  the total revenue generated per year  to evaluate business growth, Perform monthly and quarterly revenue analysis to identify seasonal trends  and also Compare year-over-year (YoY) ,month over month(MoM)revenue growth rates to measure business performance.

  ## Execution Strategy
  
•	Use aggregate functions (SUM(), COUNT(), AVG(), etc.) for high-level insights.

•	Implement JOINs to combine multiple tables (if applicable, e.g., customer details, product details).

•	Utilize window functions LAG(),(RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), ROW_NUMBER()) for ranking and trend analysis.

•	Optimize queries using indexes and performance tuning techniques to handle large datasets efficiently.

## Expected Outcomes

•	A comprehensive report on customer spending and outstanding debts.

•	A ranked list of top-selling products and lowest-selling products.

•	Identification of customers with high debt-to-purchase ratios.

•	Actionable insights for business growth and risk management.
